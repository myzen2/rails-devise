Gemfile

Installing Puma is really easy: just add gem 'puma' to your Gemfile. Done!

This section is way too easy. I'm sorry Puma isn't more complicated. ;)
Procfile

Heroku attempts to guess how you want to run your site, but sometimes it guesses wrong. I prefer to be a bit more explicit, and in Puma's case, it will guess wrong and use Webrick, so we need to do this step.

Heroku uses a gem called foreman to run your application. Basically, foreman gives you a 'Procfile' that lets you specify different processes and their types, and then foreman manages running them for you.

To use foreman, add it to your Gemfile:

gem 'foreman'

And then make a Procfile:

web: rackup -s puma -p $PORT

This says "I want my web processes to run this command." Simple. We tell rackup to use Puma with the -s flag, for 'server.'

To start up your application, normall you'd run rackup yourself, but now, you use foreman:

$ bundle exec foreman start
